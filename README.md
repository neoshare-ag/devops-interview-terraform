# devops-interview-terraform

A fellow DevOps comes to you to get some help with his task to build a new terraform stack, which also contains a terraform module.

The stack is supposed to create a S3 bucket with a replica in another region.

- Fix this terraform stack as I cannot init it. You can `terraform init` to debug the resources.
- Fix this terraform stack as I cannot validate it. You can use `terraform validate.` to debug the resources.
- Expand the configuration to also show the names of the two created S3 bucket in the output.
- Expand the configuration to also put default labels on all resources.
